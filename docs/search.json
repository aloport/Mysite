I am particularly interested in how voters perceive their identities and transform them into political positions and preferences for political candidates. I am currently involved in these research projects. My work has been published (or is accepted) in Nature Human Behavior, American Journal of Political Science and Journal of Elections, Public Opinion, and Parties."
